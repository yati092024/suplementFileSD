Both scientific and reading literacy are crucial competencies for enhancing educational standards and tackling global challenges, as outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These skills are vital for preparing future elementary school teachers to address international educational demands and contribute meaningfully to achieving the SDGs. Nevertheless, Indonesia's performance in these areas remains a concern, with below-average results in international assessments such as PISA, underscoring the pressing need for improvement. This study utilizes a quantitative correlational methodology to analyze the relationship between scientific and reading literacy. Data were gathered through standardized questionnaires completed by 158 participants from various teacher education institutions across Indonesia. The results indicate that the average reading literacy score (67.8) surpasses the average scientific literacy score (61.9), highlighting an imbalance in competency levels. Further statistical analysis reveals a significant positive relationship between the two literacies, indicating that stronger reading skills enhance scientific understanding. These results underscore the importance of implementing comprehensive strategies to improve literacy in teacher education programs. Bridging these gaps is essential for equipping future educators to meet the challenges of modern education. Efforts should prioritize the development of both scientific and reading literacy to ensure balanced and integrated skill growth. Aligning these initiatives with national and international educational priorities will help drive sustainable advancements in education quality. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","education for sustainability; interdisciplinary; science and reading integration","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012737960"

Therefore, a new educational approach is needed that is able to develop globally relevant knowledge, skills, and character values. This study aims to analyze the effect of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-based hybrid learning on the 21st-century skills and character values of prospective elementary school teachers. This study uses a mixed-methods method with an explanatory sequential design, where quantitative data is collected first and then continued with qualitative data to deepen the findings. The sample consisted of 156 students from four universities in Indonesia: Universitas PGRI Yogyakarta, STKIP Majenang, Universitas Islam Sultan Agung, and Universitas PGRI Semarang. The validity of the instrument was tested through expert judgment, while reliability was tested using Cronbach's alpha. The research instruments included an essay test to measure critical thinking skills and creativity, as well as a Likert scale questionnaire (1–5) to assess communication, collaboration, and character. Data were analyzed using Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), with results showing significant F values for all indicators (Pillai’s Trace = 7.709; Wilks’ Lambda = 8.115; Hotelling’s Trace = 8.344; Roy’s Largest Root = 14.295; p < 0.001), indicating that the hybrid-STEM model has a significant effect on improving 4C skills (critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and communication) and students’ character values. Surveys and observations also showed a positive response to this model, which was proven to improve conceptual understanding, problem-solving skills, and active involvement in learning. This study recommends strengthening STEM-based learning in higher education as a strategy to produce prospective teachers who excel academically and in character. The limitations of the study lie in the scope of the institution and the number of samples, which are still limited, so it is recommended to conduct further studies with a broader context to strengthen the generalization of the findings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","character; collaboration skills; communication; creativity; critical thinking; Indonesian education; mixed methods; teacher education","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007637905"

This study aims to analyze and classify the physical literacy levels of elementary school students using CAPL-2 and identify potential differences based on gender across three key domains: Physical Competence, Motivation & Confidence, and Knowledge & Understanding. Material and methods. A cross-sectional study design was employed, involving 169 students aged 8–12 years from ten elementary schools in Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Data were collected using CAPL-2, focusing on three domains: Physical Competence (assessed via CAMSA), Motivation & Confidence, and Knowledge & Understanding. Descriptive statistics, Independent Sample Test, and categorical classification were used for data analysis. Results. The findings revealed that the majority of students were categorized in the Beginning and Progressing levels across all domains. Boys scored slightly higher in Physical Competence, while girls outperformed boys significantly in Knowledge & Understanding (p = 0.017). No significant gender differences were observed in the Motivation & Confidence domain. Conclusions. The overall physical literacy levels of Indonesian elementary school students remain below optimal standards, with significant gaps in Knowledge & Understanding.

Therefore, integrating local culture into English subjects can help address the challenges of keeping students’ identities and enhancing their English competency. This study aims to design an English syllabus for elementary schools that includes local culture using the research and development (R&D) method utilizing the Dick and Carey Instructional Design Model. Local culture was integrated into the syllabus in specific topics, following Byram’s cultural classification framework. The results indicated that integrating local culture into the English syllabus not only enables students to preserve their cultural identities but also offers a familiar context, leading to enhanced comprehension of English language. However, the materials with local culture are quite limited, posing difficulty for teachers in disseminating such resources. Consequently, it is recommended that future research endeavors focus on creating English materials that integrate local culture and investigate the impact of local cultural interventions on students’ English achievement, as well as how incorporating local culture might help students preserve their identity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Childhood; English & Literacy/Language Arts; Local culture; Primary/Elementary Education; students’ identity; syllabus; young learners","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212280022"

The importance of cultivating reasoning skills is especially pronounced in the current era of disruption, characterized by rapid advances in information and communication technology and the automation of human labor by machines and autonomous systems. As physical tasks are increasingly performed by technology, human capacities such as reasoning and emotional intelligence become critical. Mathematical reasoning provides the foundation for understanding concepts, formulating logical arguments, and generating solutions across domains such as the natural sciences, society, and engineering, while also enabling students to approach problems critically and systematically. However, despite its significance, research in primary education has often emphasized procedural knowledge rather than examining how students construct and apply reasoning when confronted with mathematical challenges, leaving a gap in understanding how reasoning develops in authentic classroom contexts. To address this issue, the present study investigates how Grade 4 and Grade 5 students in a primary school in Banjarmasin, Indonesia, employ mathematical reasoning strategies to solve non-routine problems. Through a classroom-based experimental approach, we analyzed students’ solution pathways and the reasoning patterns they demonstrated in navigating mathematical tasks. The findings offer insights into the developmental characteristics of mathematical reasoning in upper primary school and contribute to broader discussions on fostering reasoning skills effectively, with implications for designing mathematics instruction that prepares students to meet the cognitive demands of an era increasingly shaped by automation and technological disruption. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Information and Communication Technology; Mathematical Reasoning; Students Learning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105019385474"

Despite these conceptual advancements, the design and implementation of inclusive mathematics instruction in Papua, Indonesia, remains limited. Mathematics teaching and learning in Papua are still primarily dominated using government-provided textbooks. Addressing this void, this article discusses the use of Papua Crown as an inclusive mathematics learning medium due to its relevance to learners' daily lives. We highlight the exotic and rich patterns of the Papua Crown, which can be utilized to teach elementary school mathematics, particularly geometry. We employed an ethnographic approach by conducting observations with the artisans and users of the Papua Crown, interviews with two artisans, a museum curator, an archaeologist, and an anthropology lecturer, and documentation. We analyzed the connection between the geometric patterns in the Papua crown and the geometric concept that the teacher can potentially utilize in their practice. The findings elucidate that there are three geometric patterns in the Papua Crown: the triangle, symbolizing the human spiritual relationship with nature and God; the square, representing beliefs and ways of life based on nature; and the circle, personifying the life cycle of Papuan society. We hypothesize that Papua Crown can provide meaningful and engaging mathematics teaching and learning, as learners can identify existing patterns in geometry, particularly 2D shapes. Third, using geometry patterns from the Papua Crown in teaching and learning mathematics is predicted to assist learners in learning mathematical concepts contextually and appreciate culture by constructing knowledge from their experiences. This study is expected to contribute significantly to the development of a culturally inclusive mathematics learning that enables learners to understand mathematics concepts and honor the pluralism of Indonesian society. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Culturally Inclusive Mathematics Learning; Ethnography; Ethnomathematics; Geometric Patterns; Papua Crown","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016823544"

This study investigates the effectiveness of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Problem-Based Learning (PBL) to enhance high school students’ conflict resolution skills within the context of civic education. The initiative responds to the increasing need for pedagogical models that simultaneously foster ethical reasoning, empathy, and peaceful negotiation in adolescent learners, particularly in complex socio-political environments. Materials/Methods. Using a quasi-experimental one-group pretest-posttest design, the study was conducted with 90 eleventh-grade students from three urban schools in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The intervention utilized a custom-built AI platform featuring real-time simulations of social conflicts, an NLP-based chatbot for ethical guidance, and personalized feedback mechanisms. Conflict resolution skills were measured across three core dimensions: empathy, peaceful negotiation, and ethical reasoning. Results. Statistical analyses showed significant improvements across all assessed indicators (p < 0.001), with very large effect sizes (Cohen’s d > 1.6). Post-test scores not only increased in average value but also displayed more uniform distribution, indicating effectiveness across diverse student profiles. No significant gender-based differences in learning gains were observed, suggesting the model’s inclusivity. Regression analysis revealed that students with lower baseline scores experienced the greatest improvements, underscoring the adaptive strength of the AI-PBL approach. Conclusion. The findings support the potential of AI-enhanced PBL to develop both cognitive and affective aspects of conflict resolution skills in civic education. Theoretically, this research contributes to social constructivist and differentiated instruction paradigms. Practically, it offers a promising direction for equitable technology integration in education. However, the absence of a control group and the urban-limited sample constrain broader generalization. Future studies should explore longitudinal and cross-cultural applications to evaluate the model’s sustainability and scalability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; civic education; conflict resolution skills; personalized learning; Problem-Based Learning (PBL)","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016719184"

This ability includes skills in analyzing, formulating, and finding solutions to problems related to fundamental mathematical concepts. This study aims to examine the impact of integrating the WordWall website into the Student-Centered Learning approach on numeracy problem-solving skills in elementary schools. The research context stems from the need to actively and collaboratively enhance students’ numerical skills, considering the high demands for mathematical literacy in the 21st century. This study employs a quasi-experimental design involving 60 fifth-grade students, divided into control and experimental groups. The experimental group was subjected to learning with WordWall integration, while the control group used conventional methods. Data collection was conducted through pre-tests and post-tests to assess numeracy problem-solving abilities. The analysis results indicate a significant increase in average scores in the experimental group compared to the control group (p < 0.05), with a percentage increase of 30% from pre-test to post-test. Additionally, the achievement of learning objectives is reflected in the high level of student participation during the learning process, as evidenced by positive feedback and increased learning motivation.

Recognizing that literacy development is shaped by multifactorial and hierarchical influences, the research employs a systems-based methodology to identify, structure, and analyze the interrelationships among key educational variables. The study utilized expert judgment to construct a Structural Self-Interaction Matrix (SSIM), followed by the generation of the Initial and Final Reachability Matrices (IRM and FRM) to establish a four-level ISM hierarchy. DEMATEL was then applied to quantify the direct and indirect influence among the factors, resulting in a cause-effect diagram that classified each variable as a driver, mediator, or outcome. The findings indicate that foundational elements—such as policy support, curriculum alignment, and teacher training—serve as primary causal factors that influence mid-level instructional processes and ultimately shape student literacy outcomes. The integration of ISM and DEMATEL provides a unique methodological contribution, combining structural depth with analytical precision. This dual approach enables educators and policymakers to not only understand which factors matter, but also how strongly they influence the system. The originality of this study lies in its synthesis of two decision-support methods to develop a practical, scalable, and evidence-based model of writing instruction tailored to the Indonesian primary education context.

This study aimed to identify teaching materials currently employed in elementary science education fourth-grade students in ‘Sekolah Penggerak’ programs in Sukoharjo Regency, Central Java, Indonesia, and assess students’ scientific literacy within this context. Method: the study employed a descriptive qualitative approach with participants including fourth-grade educators and students from elementary schools in the “Sekolah Penggerak” program in a Javanese province, Indonesia. Two schools participated: State Elementary School 02 Duwet and State Elementary School 04 Ngadirejo. Data were obtained through surveys and interviews using purposive sampling techniques. Questionnaires were distributed to students, while interview data were gathered from teachers. Results: the majority of teaching resources were government-or publisher-provided books that lacked cultural relevance and were not designed to improve scientific literacy. Teachers had not created instructional materials that were literacy-focused or culturally appropriate. Scientific literacy levels among students were found to be very low. Conclusions: the findings demonstrated the urgent need to develop ethnoscience-based instructional materials that integrated local culture, technology, and inquiry-based learning methodologies. Such resources would strengthen students’ comprehension, increase their scientific literacy, and provide tangible learning experiences that connected scientific concepts to their cultural context. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ethnoscience; Science Education; Scientific Literacy; Teaching Materials","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014798638"

This study examines the impact of Moodle-assisted e-modules as an interactive learning tool using a quasi-experimental design with a mixed-methods approach and longitudinal analysis. A total of 150 fifth-grade elementary school students in Cirebon City, West Java, Indonesia, participated in the experimental group using Moodle-assisted e-modules, while another 150 students in the control group relied on conventional textbooks. Quantitative data were analyzed through paired t-tests, N-gain scores, and repeated-measures Analysis of Variances (ANOVAs), while qualitative data were collected via interviews with educators and students. The findings revealed that post-test scores in the experimental group were significantly higher than in the control group. The control group achieved an N-gain score of 0.23 (low category), whereas the experimental group attained 0.62 (medium category). The longitudinal analysis further confirmed that the improvement in numeracy literacy skills was substantial and long-lasting (F = 341.724, p < 0.001). Additionally, questionnaire responses indicated that most students found the Moodle-assisted e-modules engaging and motivating, which enhanced their understanding of the subject matter. These results highlight the effectiveness of technology-assisted learning in improving numeracy skills and fostering innovation in teaching methods. By adapting to diverse learning styles, this approach can be widely implemented to increase student engagement and enhance foundational education. The study underscores the long-term benefits of integrating digital learning tools into elementary education. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","electronic module; Moodle; numeracy literacy; technology","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014652767"

This study aims to adapt CAPL-2 to assess the improvement in the physical literacy of children between the ages of 8 to 12 years and prove the construct validity, content validity, and determine the estimated reliability of the CAPL-2 according to the characteristics of Indonesian elementary school children. Material and methods Preliminary validity and reliability estimates of the CAPL-2 (Indonesia) were studied using cross-sectional methods resulting from public elementary school students in Central Lombok, NTB, Indonesia. A total of 7 experts/academics (expert judgment) to prove the content validity of CAPL-2, and as many as 84 children (43 boys and 41 girls; mean age = 10.05; standard deviation = 0.74) to prove construct validity and estimated reliability of CAPL-2. The measurements in this study were designed to provide descriptive results on 3 core domains of physical literacy: (1) Motivation & Confidence; (2) Physical Competence (CAMSA Score); (3) Knowledge & Understanding. Results The descriptive statistical results show the low level of physical literacy of children assessed by CAPL-2, which can raise concerns and doubts in the implementation process. However, the findings of this research also show strong empirical support for the construct validity, content validity, and estimated reliability of CAPL-2 that can be used to assess the physical literacy of children between the ages of 8 to 12 years in Indonesia. Proof of preliminary validity shows an acceptable value of validity, whereas, a low estimated value of reliability is produced only on the Knowledge and Understanding questionnaire.

Exploratory factor analysis was conducted within the scope of scale validity, and its internal consistency was analyzed for reliability. Data for the exploratory factor analysis were collected from 112 elementary school teachers in various regions of Indonesia who had implemented differentiated mathematics learning during the academic year 2022-2023. Aiken's analysis was used to measure the content validity from expert judgment. As a result of the exploratory factor analysis, three underlying factors were formed in the construction of the construct validity of the instrument: MR1 (learning management), MR2 (coaching and continuous learning), and MR3 (teaching strategies). The questionnaire instrument, consisting of 27 items, had factor loadings between 0.385 and 0.851. The significant values for EFA were overall MSA = 0.89, χ2 = 1944.1; df = 351; SRMR = 0.057; and CFI = 0.97, indicating an acceptable level of fit that confirms the three-factor structure. The findings suggest that the developed scale is a valid and reliable measure for determining the readiness perceptions of elementary school teachers toward differentiated mathematics learning.

Learning experiments were conducted in rural elementary schools in Indonesia. We used an artificial intelligence (AI)-based mobile application to help students recognize ornamental plants via cell cameras and obtain information directly. This study employed a quasi-experimental design with pre-and post-test methods. Ninety-three students in Grades 5 and 6 participated in the study. An application was developed using the MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network model. For one month, students worked in small groups to search for and identify ornamental plants in the surrounding environment. This study demonstrates that AI-based applications can improve student engagement and understanding. The results showed an increase of 35% in comprehension after they used the application. Interviews and observations indicated that the students were more enthusiastic about learning because they received instant feedback and a more interactive learning experience. We identified several obstacles during the experiment, including limited digital literacy and infrastructure readiness. These obstacles can hinder the implementation of AI applications in real learning. We recommend that schools conduct capacity building for teachers and develop adequate infrastructure to further implement this technology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI Education; Mobile Learning; MobileNetV2; Ornamental Plants; Student Engagement","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001710345"

The growing popularity of the coastal area’s industry in the Sidoarjo district, East Java, Indonesia, not only had a significant impact on the local economy, but it has also caused ecological problems and an overall decrease in student literacy rates. Ecoliteracy is crucial to developing sustainable thinking in the next generation. Given the significant ecological challenges posed by the rapid expansion of agricultural industries in coastal areas, the study investigates the integration of local culture into educational materials to improve students’ understanding and appreciation for their surroundings Study participants and methods. The type of research used is quasi-experimental with a pretest-posttest control group design pattern. The sample in this research is the primary school located in the coastal area’s farming, among them SDN Banjar Kemuning, Sedati District, SDN Gisik Cemandi, Sedati District and SDN Balongtani, Jabon District, all of them at Sidoarjo, with a total of 86 students. Data collected using test and lifting techniques consisting of 5 indicators of eco-literation understanding. Test the hypothesis using independent t-test samples and using n-gain analysis. Results. The outcome of the research revealed that local-culture supplementary books were successful at increasing student eco-literacy in desired areas. This is demonstrated by the experimental class having a higher average value and n-gain value than the control class. Based on the results of the hypothesis test using the independent formula sample t-test obtained a significance value of 0,000 < 0,05 and t-value > t-table (8,486 > 1,663). The use of this supplementary book not only improves students’ knowledge of the environment but also motivates them to be more caring and responsible for the ecosystems around them. Integrating local wisdom into formal education can be an effective model for environmental education in a variety of other local contexts. Practical significance. The study analysed the effectiveness of local cultural supplement books in improving student eco-literation in the coastal region of Sidoarjo, East Java, Indonesia. This research makes an important contribution to students’ understanding of local ecosystems, using local wisdom as a relevant and useful learning foundation. By considering the introduction of typical foods, local cultures, and traditional habitat points in the supplementary book, the study provides a better understanding to students of the complex relationship between humans and the environment in the desire area. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","coastal areas; ecoliteracy; environmental education; local-culture; supplement book","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001696507"

It is important at the elementary school level because it is the basis for abilities at the next school level. In reality, the current learning in schools is not optimally focused on increasing mathematical literacy. This research aims to analyze differences in students’ literacy abilities based on learning approach (digital STEAM-inquiry learning [digital STEAMIL] module vs. conventional), geography (urban vs. rural), gender (male vs. female), and internet access. The research conducted was a quasi-experiment with a nonequivalent posttest-only group design. The subjects in this study were elementary school students in urban (N = 77) and rural areas (N = 65). Data was collected through technical tests (mathematical literacy post-test). Research data analysis used inferential statistics, ANOVA and post-hoc test (LSD). The results of the research showed that at the 95% confidence level, there was a difference in students’ mathematical literacy between the use of the digital STEAMIL module and conventional. There are differences based on demographics, where urban students’ mathematical literacy skills are better than rural students’ after learning with the digital STEAMIL module. However, there was no difference in gender (male vs. female) in mathematical literacy abilities. The intensity of internet access influences literacy skills after using the digital STEAMIL module, students who frequently access the internet tend to have higher mathematical literacy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","elementary school; inquiry learning; mathematical literacy; STEAMIL; urban and rural","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000836542"

This qualitative study utilized a case study approach to examine the cognitive processes of elementary students affected by natural number bias, contributing to the advancement of cognitive theories in mathematics instruction. Nonrandom purposive sampling was employed to select participants, with 171 fifth-grade students in Malang undergoing a paper-and-pencil exam. After screening, only seven students qualified as research participants. Data collection involved mathematical tests and video-audio interviews, with responses recorded and analyzed through coding and interpretation. Investigator triangulation ensured reliability. The findings reveal that students predominantly use rule-based strategies for fractional operations and number sense strategies for fractional comparisons, demonstrating a clear distinction in their approaches. Furthermore, a pattern of systematic errors was identified: students relying on rule-based strategies tended to make errors in conceptual tasks, while those using number sense strategies struggled with procedural tasks. These results emphasize the importance of balancing rule-based procedural skills and number sense understanding in teaching. The study recommends developing comprehensive mathematics learning materials that promote diagram representation, problem-solving strategies, conceptual understanding of fractions, and mathematical reasoning to support students' deeper understanding of rational numbers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","natural number bias; number sense strategies; rule-based strategies","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000233981"

This article presents SLR on RME in digital-era elementary schools from 2022 to 2024. This research method is SLR and PRISMA assisted by the Publish or Perish 8 application, VOSviewer version 1.6.20, Mendeley version 1.19.8, and ATLAS.ti version 7.5.16. The findings of 757 Scopus articles were filtered to 33 and analyzed with ATLAS.ti, and the results were presented according to the research questions. The study findings revealed that RME is a mathematics learning approach from Freudenthal's learning theory, which, since 2016, has developed as a “new math” approach to bring students closer to mathematics, directing students to become inventors and researchers. RME is applied with digital mathematical tools, Hypothetical Learning Trajectory (HLT) games, virtual Lesson Study for Learning Community (LSLC), primary school geometry learning, curriculum, media, numerical, computational, translation, reflection, realistic word problems, mathematical beliefs, applications, scientific reporting, and Realistic Mathematics Engineering (RMEng). Indonesia, Malaysia, and Australia are the countries that implement digital integrated RME. RME learning with ICT improves higher-order thinking skills in geometry, beam trajectory, student ability in the ellipse, mathematical competence of slow learner students, mathematical literacy, exploration, collaboration, STEM projects, problem-solving skills in grades 1-3, data concepts in grade 4, data presentation in grade 5, and data processing in grade 6.
